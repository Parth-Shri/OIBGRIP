# OIBGRIP
# First task of Oasis Data Science Internship - Iris Flower Classification 

Prerequisites - 
1. Iris Dataset
2. Knowledge of Python
3. Knowledge of Data Cleaning and Data Visualization.

=> Iris dataset is a most common dataset used for analysing and applying Data Science concepts.

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
