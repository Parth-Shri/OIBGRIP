# First task of Oasis Data Science Internship - Iris Flower Classification 
Iris dataset is a most common dataset used for analysing and applying Data Science concepts.
In this task we have to use ML models to train the model on categorical column (Species) and numerical columns (SepalLengthCm, PetalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalWidthCm)
and predict the outcomes on the basis of train and test dataframes.


# Second task of Oasis Data Science Internship - Unemployment Rate
In this task we have to generate the summary of the unemployment rate in different states using data visualization.


# Third task of Oasisi Data Science Internship - Spam Classification
In this task we analyze the dataset and train the model to examine which mail is Spam and which is not using ML models. Also we used the concepts of data visualization to easily understand the patterns.
